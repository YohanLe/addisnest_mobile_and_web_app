# Property Detail API Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed
When clicking on property cards, the system was showing mock property details instead of real data from the database. This was causing a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to retrieve property details from the API.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Typo in the property routes file: `autorize` instead of `authorize` in the route middleware
