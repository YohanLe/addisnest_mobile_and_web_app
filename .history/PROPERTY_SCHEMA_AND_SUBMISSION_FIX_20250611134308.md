# Property Schema Update and Submission Fix

## Overview

This document details the changes made to fix property submission issues and update the MongoDB schema to match the required structure.

## Problem

After submission, property data was not being saved to the database despite successful API responses. The issue was caused by:

1. A mismatch between the frontend data structure and the MongoDB schema
2. The frontend was sending a nested `address` object, but the database schema was updated to use flat top-level fields
3. Unnecessary `paymentStatus` field was causing validation errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated MongoDB Property Schema (`src/models/Property.js`)

The schema was updated to match the required structure:

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId(),
  "owner": ObjectId(),
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "propertyType": "...",
  "offeringType": "...",
  "status": "...",
  "price": 100000,
  "area": 1500,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bathrooms": 2,
  "street": "...",
  "city": "...",
  "state": "...",
  "country": "...",
  "images": [ { "url": "..." } ],
  "features": { "hasPool": true },
  "promotionType": "VIP",
  "isPremium": true,
  "isVerified": true,
  "views": 42,
  "likes": 5,
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "..."
}
```

Key changes:
- Address fields are now top-level properties (street, city, state, country)
- Features is now a mixed-type object with hasPool property
- Images array contains objects with url property
- Added fields for promotionType, isPremium, isVerified, views, and likes

### 2. Updated Frontend Component (`ChoosePropmotion.jsx`)

Modified the frontend component to:
- Remove nested address object and use flat top-level address fields
- Update features object format to match the new schema
- Fix image format to ensure it matches the expected structure

```javascript
// Updated format
const formattedData = {
  // Other fields...
  street: data.street || data.property_address || data.address?.street || "Unknown Street",
  city: data.city || data.address?.city || "Unknown City",
  state: data.regional_state || data.address?.state || "Unknown State", 
  country: data.country || data.address?.country || "Ethiopia",
  features: {
    "hasPool": true,
    // Other features...
  }
};
```

### 3. Updated Backend Controller (`propertyController.js`)

Updated the controller to:
- Remove `paymentStatus` field from the property model
- Handle both flat and nested address formats
- Convert legacy fields to match the new schema structure

```javascript
// Handle address fields if they come from a nested structure
if (req.body.address && typeof req.body.address === 'object') {
  // Extract address fields to top-level properties
  req.body.street = req.body.street || req.body.address.street || req.body.property_address || "Unknown Street";
  req.body.city = req.body.city || req.body.address.city || "Unknown City";
  req.body.state = req.body.state || req.body.address.state || req.body.regional_state || "Unknown State";
  req.body.country = req.body.country || req.body.address.country || "Ethiopia";
  
  // Remove the nested address object as it's not part of the schema anymore
  delete req.body.address;
}
```

## Verification

The following tests were created to verify the fix:

1. `test-property-model-validation.js` - Validates the schema structure
2. `test-property-schema-update.js` - Creates a test property with the new schema
3. `verify-property-schema-update.js` - Detailed verification of schema fields
4. `test-property-submission-final.js` - End-to-end test of the property submission process

## How to Test

1. Run the tests using the provided batch file:
```
test-property-schema-update.bat
```

2. Test the frontend property submission flow:
   - Fill out the property form and submit
   - Choose a promotion plan
   - Verify the property is saved to the database and appears in listings

## Conclusion

The property submission issue has been fixed by aligning the frontend data structure with the updated MongoDB schema and correctly handling address fields. This ensures property data is correctly saved to the database when users submit property listings.
