# Property Form Fields Update Summary

## Changes Made:

1. **Field Renaming:**
   - Renamed "Property Address" to "Street Name" in both PropertyListForm and EditPropertyForm components
   - Updated placeholder text and validation messages to reflect the new field name

2. **Layout Restructuring:**
   - Reorganized address fields to display horizontally in a single row
   - Implemented a 4-column layout with fields in this order:
     1. Street Name
     2. City
     3. Regional State
     4. Country

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Created a new CSS file (property-form-styles.css) with responsive grid layouts
   - Added media queries to ensure proper display on different screen sizes:
     - 4 columns on large screens
     - 2 columns on medium screens
     - 1 column on small screens

## Technical Implementation:

1. **CSS Grid System:**
   - Created form-row-4-cols class for the horizontal layout
   - Implemented form-col-25 class for equal width columns
   - Added responsive behavior using media queries

2. **Component Changes:**
   - Updated both property submission and property edit forms with the new layout
   - Ensured proper alignment and spacing of form fields
   - Maintained all validation functionality and error messages
   - Updated labels and placeholders for consistency

## Testing:

The updated forms have been implemented in:
- src/components/property-list-form/sub-component/PropertyListForm.jsx
- src/components/property-edit-form/sub-component/EditPropertyForm.jsx

Both forms now display the address fields in a horizontal row with "Street Name" as the first field.
