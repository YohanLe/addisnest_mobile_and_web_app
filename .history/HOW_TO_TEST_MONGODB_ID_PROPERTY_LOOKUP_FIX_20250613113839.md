# How to Test the MongoDB ID Property Lookup Fix

This document provides instructions for testing the MongoDB ID property lookup fix, which resolves the 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing property detail pages using MongoDB ObjectIDs.

## Background

Previously, when attempting to access property detail pages using MongoDB ObjectIDs (24-character hexadecimal strings like `684a5fb17cb3172bbb3c75d7`), the application would encounter multiple API errors:

1. 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing `/api/properties/mongo-id/{id}`
2. 500 Internal Server Error when falling back to standard property endpoints
3. Failed direct database queries with 401 Unauthorized errors

These issues have been fixed by implementing proper authentication handling and dedicated public endpoints for MongoDB ID lookups.

## Testing Methods

There are several ways to test this fix:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Test Script

The most comprehensive test is running the automated test script:

```bash
node test-property-mongo-id-fix.js
```

Or use the batch file:

```bash
run-property-mongo-id-fix-test.bat
```

This script will:
1. Start the server with the MongoDB ID lookup fix
2. Test all three property lookup endpoints with the MongoDB ID
3. Display detailed results for each endpoint

### Method 2: Launch the Full Application

To test the fix in the context of the full application:

```bash
node launch-with-mongo-id-fix.js
```

This script will:
1. Start the backend server with the MongoDB ID fix
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Open a browser window to a property detail page using a MongoDB ID

### Method 3: Start the Server Manually

You can also test the fix by starting the server manually:

```bash
start-app-with-mongo-id-fix.bat
```

Then open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:5175/property/684a5fb17cb3172bbb3c75d7
```

## What to Look For

When testing the fix, you should see:

1. **Successful API Responses**: Check the browser console for successful API calls to the `/api/properties/mongo-id/{id}` endpoint. There should be no 401 Unauthorized errors.

2. **Property Data Loading**: The property detail page should successfully load with all property information displayed.

3. **Console Logs**: The console should show which endpoint was used to retrieve the property data.

## Verification Steps

1. **Verify Backend Fix**: Run `node test-property-mongo-id-fix.js` and confirm that at least one of the endpoints returns a successful response.

2. **Verify Frontend Fix**: Open the property detail page in a browser and confirm:
   - No 401 Unauthorized errors in the console
   - Property details are displayed correctly
   - The page doesn't show "Property Not Found"

3. **Verify Error Handling**: If you try an invalid MongoDB ID, the application should show an appropriate error message rather than failing silently.

## Implemented Changes

The fix includes the following changes:

1. **Backend**:
   - Created dedicated route handlers for MongoDB ID lookups
   - Configured these routes to be public (no auth required)
   - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms

2. **Frontend**:
   - Updated API client to handle authentication correctly
   - Modified Redux slice to process API responses properly
   - Enhanced error handling for failed requests

These changes ensure that property detail pages can be accessed reliably using MongoDB ObjectIDs without authentication errors.
