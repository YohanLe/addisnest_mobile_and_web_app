# MongoDB ID Property Edit Fix

This document outlines the implementation of MongoDB _id field support for the property edit functionality.

## Problem

When users click on the edit button in the property listings grid, the system previously only supported standard property IDs but had issues with MongoDB-style _id fields (24-character hexadecimal strings). This caused properties with MongoDB IDs to fail during edit operations.

## Solution

The solution involves several components working together:

1. **Enhanced PropertyListingsTab.jsx Edit Button Handler**
   - When users click the Edit button, we now explicitly capture the MongoDB _id field
   - Data is normalized and stored in localStorage with proper keys

2. **New API Endpoint in propertyController.js**
   - Added `getPropertyByMongoId` method that specifically handles MongoDB ObjectId format
   - This method performs lookup by both _id and id fields for flexibility

3. **Updated Routes in propertyRoutes.js**
   - Added `/mongo-id/:id` route that connects to the new controller method

4. **Enhanced EditPropertyForm.jsx**
   - Improved property data retrieval with better fallback mechanisms
   - Added robust handling of MongoDB IDs during form population

## Testing

Two testing tools have been created:

1. **test-mongodb-id-property-edit.js**
   - Simulates the Edit button click with a MongoDB-formatted property
   - Verifies data is properly stored in localStorage with correct keys
   - Provides validation steps to ensure the fix works correctly

2. **run-mongodb-id-test.bat**
   - Simple batch script to run the test quickly

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes:

1. Added explicit MongoDB _id field handling in PropertyListingsTab.jsx:
```javascript
const normalizedProperty = {
  id: item.id || item._id,
  propertyId: item.id || item._id,
  _id: item._id || item.id,  // Include MongoDB _id field explicitly
  // other properties...
};
```

2. Added dedicated MongoDB ID endpoint in propertyController.js:
```javascript
getPropertyByMongoId = this.asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Get the MongoDB _id from params
  let mongoId = req.params.id;
  
  // First try direct _id lookup
  let property = await Property.findOne({ _id: mongoId });
  
  // If not found, try id field (some records might use id instead of _id)
  if (!property) {
    property = await Property.findOne({ id: mongoId });
  }
  
  // Return the property
  this.sendResponse(res, property);
});
```

3. Added new route in propertyRoutes.js:
```javascript
router.get('/mongo-id/:id', propertyController.getPropertyByMongoId);
```

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. Run the test script: `run-mongodb-id-test.bat`
2. Or open test-mongodb-id-property-edit.js and run with Node.js
3. Check that the property data is correctly stored in localStorage with the MongoDB _id
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/property-edit/[MongoDB_ID] to verify form population
