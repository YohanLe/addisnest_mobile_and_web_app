# Property Address Validation Fix

## Problem
The property submission was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error due to address validation issues in the MongoDB model. The error details showed:

```
API error details: {
  success: false, 
  error: 'Please add a country, Please add a state, Please add a city, Please add a street address'
}
```

## Root Cause
After investigating the `Property.js` model, we discovered that the model expects address fields in a nested structure:

```javascript
address: {
  street: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please add a street address']
  },
  city: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please add a city']
  },
  state: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please add a state']
  },
  country: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please add a country']
  },
  // ...
}
```

However, the frontend was sending flat address fields (`street`, `city`, `regional_state`, `country`) instead of the nested structure, causing the validation to fail.

## Solution
We implemented a two-part fix:

1. **In `savePropertyToDatabase()`**: Added a nested `address` object to the formatted data while maintaining the flat fields for backward compatibility:

```javascript
// Format property data for API call
const formattedData = {
  // ...other fields
  
  // CRITICAL FIX: Add a nested address object as required by mongoose model
  address: {
    street: data.street || data.property_address || data.address?.street || "Unknown Street",
    city: data.city || data.address?.city || "Unknown City",
    state: data.regional_state || data.address?.state || "Unknown State",
    country: data.country || data.address?.country || "Ethiopia"
  },
  
  // Keep flat fields for backward compatibility
  street: data.street || data.property_address || data.address?.street || "Unknown Street",
  city: data.city || data.address?.city || "Unknown City",
  regional_state: data.regional_state || data.address?.state || "Unknown State",
  country: data.country || data.address?.country || "Ethiopia",
  
  // ...other fields
};
```

2. **In `handleContinue()`**: Ensured the address fields preparation includes the nested structure:

```javascript
// Prepare address fields with fallbacks
const street = dataToUse.street || dataToUse.property_address || dataToUse.address?.street || "Unknown Address";
const city = dataToUse.city || dataToUse.address?.city || "Unknown City";
const state = dataToUse.regional_state || dataToUse.address?.state || "Unknown State";
const country = dataToUse.country || dataToUse.address?.country || "Ethiopia";

// Set both flat fields and nested address structure
dataToUse = {
  ...dataToUse,
  // Flat fields for backward compatibility
  city: city,
  regional_state: state,
  country: country,
  street: street,
  // CRITICAL FIX: Add the proper nested address structure required by mongoose
  address: {
    street: street,
    city: city,
    state: state,
    country: country
  }
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Resolves Validation Errors**: Property submissions will no longer fail due to address validation issues
2. **Maintains Compatibility**: Keeps flat address fields for backward compatibility with existing code
3. **Robust Fallbacks**: Includes multiple fallback options to ensure address fields are never empty
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligns the frontend data structure with the MongoDB schema expectations

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Run the application with the updated `ChoosePropmotion.jsx` file
2. Fill out a property form with or without complete address fields
3. Select a promotion plan and click "Continue"
4. The property should be successfully saved without address validation errors
