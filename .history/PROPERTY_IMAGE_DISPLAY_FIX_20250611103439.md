# Property Image Display and New Listing Fix in Account Management

## Problems Fixed
1. **Image Display Issue**: Property images were not displaying correctly in the account management listings grid after a user submits a property form. The issue was that image paths in the data structure sometimes lacked the required leading slash, causing broken image references.

2. **Missing New Properties**: Newly submitted properties weren't appearing in the property listings grid after submission. The component wasn't capturing properties passed via navigation state.

## Solutions
1. **Image Path Fix**: Updated the image path resolution logic in the `PropertyListingsTab.jsx` component to ensure all image paths are properly formatted with a leading slash. The fix now checks if the path starts with '/' and adds it if missing.

2. **New Property Display Fix**: Enhanced the `PropertyListingsTab.jsx` component to detect newly submitted properties from the navigation state and save them to localStorage to ensure they appear in the grid immediately after submission.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Image Path Fix in `src/components/account-management/sub-component/account-tab/PropertyListingsTab.jsx`:

```diff
- if (typeof mainImage === 'string') {
-   console.log("Using string URL from media_paths");
-   return mainImage;
- } else if (mainImage.filePath) {
-   console.log("Using filePath from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.filePath;
- } else if (mainImage.url) {
-   console.log("Using url from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.url;
- } else if (mainImage.path) {
-   console.log("Using path from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.path;
- }

+ if (typeof mainImage === 'string') {
+   console.log("Using string URL from media_paths");
+   return mainImage.startsWith('/') ? mainImage : `/${mainImage}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.filePath) {
+   console.log("Using filePath from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.filePath;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.url) {
+   console.log("Using url from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.url;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.path) {
+   console.log("Using path from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.path;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ }
```

Similar changes were made to all the image path resolution code in the component, ensuring consistent path handling throughout.

### 2. New Property Display Fix in `src/components/account-management/sub-component/account-tab/PropertyListingsTab.jsx`:

```diff
+ // Check for newly submitted property in navigation state
+ const [newSubmittedProperty, setNewSubmittedProperty] = useState(null);
+ 
+ useEffect(() => {
+   // Check if we have a new property in the navigation state
+   if (location.state?.propertyData && location.state?.showPropertyAlert) {
+     console.log("Found newly submitted property in navigation state:", location.state.propertyData);
+     setNewSubmittedProperty(location.state.propertyData);
+     
+     // Store in localStorage for persistence
+     try {
+       // Get existing property listings from localStorage
+       const existingListings = localStorage.getItem('propertyListings');
+       const parsedListings = existingListings ? JSON.parse(existingListings) : [];
+       
+       // Add the new property to the array
+       const updatedListings = [location.state.propertyData, ...parsedListings];
+       
+       // Save back to localStorage
+       localStorage.setItem('propertyListings', JSON.stringify(updatedListings));
+       console.log("Saved newly submitted property to localStorage");
+     } catch (error) {
+       console.error("Error saving new property to localStorage:", error);
+     }
+   }
+ }, [location.state]);

// Modified property list combination to prioritize newly submitted property
- const combinedPropertyList = [...(propertyListData || []), ...localStorageProperties];
+ const combinedPropertyList = [
+   ...(newSubmittedProperty ? [newSubmittedProperty] : []), // Add newly submitted property first (highest priority)
+   ...(propertyListData || []),                             // Then API/database data
+   ...localStorageProperties                                // Then localStorage data
+ ];
```

This change ensures that properties submitted via the form process are immediately visible in the listings grid, even before they are returned from the API.

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Using the Property Image Display Test Page

1. Open the HTML test page:
   ```
   property-image-display-test.html
   ```

2. This page provides:
   - Explanation of the fix
   - Sample property card showing an image from the uploads folder
   - A button to set up test data in localStorage and redirect to the account management page

3. Click the "Test in Account Management" button to:
   - Store test property data in localStorage (including one with a leading slash and one without)
   - Set up mock authentication
   - Redirect to the account management page

4. Verify that both test properties show their images correctly in the grid

### Method 2: Manually Submitting a Property

1. Start the application with the fixed server:
   ```
   node fixed-launcher.js
   ```

2. Navigate to the Property List Form page
3. Create a new property with images
4. Complete the submission process
5. Go to Account Management and verify images are displaying correctly

## Technical Details

The root cause of the issue was inconsistent path formatting in the property data structure. Some image paths in the data were stored with a leading slash (e.g., `/uploads/image.jpg`), while others were stored without it (e.g., `uploads/image.jpg`). 

The browser requires paths to start with a slash when they're relative to the site root. The fix ensures all paths are properly formatted regardless of how they're stored in the data structure.

## Status

âœ… Both fixes implemented and tested:
- Image paths now display correctly in property listings grid
- Newly submitted properties now appear immediately in the listings grid
