# MongoDB ID Property Lookup Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing errors when attempting to fetch property details using MongoDB ObjectIDs. The error logs showed:

- 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing `/api/properties/mongo-id/{id}`
- 500 Internal Server Error when trying fallback to standard property endpoints
- Failed direct database queries with 401 Unauthorized errors

These errors occurred because:

1. The MongoDB ID endpoint in the route configuration was pointing to a controller method that didn't exist
2. The MongoDB ID lookup route was incorrectly configured, requiring authentication for what should be a public endpoint
3. No proper fallback mechanisms were in place for retrieving properties by MongoDB ID

## Solution

The fix implements a three-part solution:

1. **Standalone Route Handlers**: Created dedicated Express route handlers specifically for MongoDB ID lookups that don't require authentication
2. **Multiple Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented three different approaches to fetch property data:
   - Primary `/mongo-id/:id` endpoint - optimized for MongoDB ID lookups
   - Fallback `/direct-db-query/:id` endpoint - direct database query as a last resort
   - Standard property endpoint as a third option
3. **Route Registration Order**: Ensured the MongoDB ID routes are registered before the general property routes to prevent route conflicts

## Implementation Details

### 1. Property MongoDB ID Fix Module

Created a new module (`property-mongo-id-fix.js`) that:
- Provides standalone route handlers for MongoDB ID lookups
- Validates MongoDB ID format
- Implements error handling and logging
- Returns standardized response formats
- Updates view counts for properties when possible

### 2. Fixed Routes Configuration

Created a new routes file (`propertyRoutes-mongo-id-fix.js`) that:
- Registers the MongoDB ID handlers before other routes
- Maintains all other existing route functionality
- Preserves route authorization for protected endpoints

### 3. Main Routes Integration

Updated the main routes index (`routes/index.js`) to use the fixed routes implementation.

## Testing

A test script (`test-property-mongo-id-fix.js`) is provided to verify the fix. The script:

1. Starts the server with the MongoDB ID lookup fix
2. Makes direct requests to all three property lookup endpoints
3. Displays the results in a clear, color-coded format

Run the test using the included batch file:
```
run-property-mongo-id-fix-test.bat
```

## Expected Results

After applying this fix, the property detail pages should successfully load when using MongoDB ObjectIDs. The API will:

1. First try the `/mongo-id/:id` endpoint without requiring authentication
2. If that fails, fall back to the standard property endpoint
3. As a last resort, try a direct database query

Each of these endpoints is properly configured to be publicly accessible, eliminating the 401 Unauthorized errors.
