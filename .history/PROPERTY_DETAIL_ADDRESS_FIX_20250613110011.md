# Property Detail Address Fix

## Issue Description
The property detail page was displaying an error for specific properties like the one with ID `6849e2ef7cb3172bbb3c718d`. The error was:

```
Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {street, city, state, country}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
```

The issue occurred because the `address` field in the Redux store was defined as an object, but the PropertyDetail component was trying to render it directly as text.

## Root Cause
In the `PropertyDetailSlice.js` file, the address was defined as an object with street, city, state, and country properties:

```javascript
address: {
  street: '123 Main St',
  city: 'Example City',
  state: 'Example State',
  country: 'Ethiopia'
},
```

However, the PropertyDetail.jsx component was trying to render this object directly in an h1 tag, which React doesn't allow.

## Solution
The fix was to convert the address object to a string format in the PropertyDetailSlice.js file:

```javascript
address: '123 Main St, Example City, Example State, Ethiopia',
```

This change was made in two places:
1. In the mock properties array at the top of the file
2. In the fallback data for the specific property ID when API calls fail

## Implementation Details
The fix ensures that the address is always provided as a string, which the PropertyDetail component can render properly. The string concatenates all the address components with commas.

In the API response transformation code, we already had proper handling to ensure that address objects are converted to strings:

```javascript
address: apiData.property_address || 
  (apiData.address ? 
    (typeof apiData.address === 'string' ? apiData.address : 
    `${apiData.address.street || ''}, ${apiData.address.city || ''}, ${apiData.address.state || ''}`) : 
    `${apiData.street || ''}, ${apiData.city || ''}, ${apiData.state || ''}`),
```

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Navigating to the property detail page for the specific property ID: `6849e2ef7cb3172bbb3c718d`
2. Verifying that the property details render correctly without any React errors
3. Confirming that all property information including the address is displayed properly

## Additional Notes
- This fix is part of a series of improvements to make the property detail page more robust in handling different data formats.
- The address handling in the API response transformation already had logic to handle both string and object formats, but the fallback mock data needed to be updated to match this expectation.
