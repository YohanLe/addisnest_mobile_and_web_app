# Property Submission 500 Error Fix - Image Format Issue

## Problem

The application was encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to submit property listings. The error occurred during the API call to create a new property via the `ChoosePropmotionFixed.jsx` component.

Error from console:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error in postWithtoken for properties: AxiosError
Error during Api.postWithtoken call: AxiosError
API error details: Object
Detailed error in savePropertyToDatabase: Error: API call failed: Request failed with status code 500
```

## Root Cause

After analyzing the code, the issue was identified as an image format problem. The Property model expects `images` to be an array of objects with a specific format, but the data being sent to the API had inconsistent image object structures.

The specific issues were:
1. Images with additional fields beyond what the schema expected
2. Mixed formats in the images array (some with captions, some with only URLs)
3. Possibly empty or malformed image objects

## Solution

The fix involves normalizing the image data structure before sending it to the API. Specifically:

1. Ensuring all image objects have a consistent format with just the `url` property
2. Filtering out any empty or invalid image URLs
3. Providing default images if none are available

### Implementation

The following code was added to the `savePropertyToDatabase` function in `ChoosePropmotionFixed.jsx`:

```javascript
// Ensure images are in the correct format expected by the server
if (formattedData.images && Array.isArray(formattedData.images)) {
  // Convert all image objects to have only the url property
  formattedData.images = formattedData.images.map(img => {
    // If it's already a string or url is not defined, handle accordingly
    if (typeof img === 'string') {
      return { url: img };
    } else if (img && typeof img === 'object') {
      return { url: img.url || img.path || '' };
    }
    return { url: '' };
  });
  
  // Filter out any empty URLs
  formattedData.images = formattedData.images.filter(img => img.url && img.url.trim() !== '');
  
  // If no valid images, use default images
  if (formattedData.images.length === 0) {
    formattedData.images = DEFAULT_IMAGES.map(img => ({ url: img.url }));
  }
} else {
  // If no images at all, use default images
  formattedData.images = DEFAULT_IMAGES.map(img => ({ url: img.url }));
}
```

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Navigate to the property listing form and complete it
2. Proceed to the Choose Promotion page
3. Select a plan and continue
4. The property should be created successfully without any 500 errors

## Related Issues

This fix addresses one aspect of property submission errors. Previous fixes have addressed:
1. Removing `status` and `paymentStatus` fields to let the server determine these values
2. Validating required fields before submission
3. Ensuring proper address field structure

## Further Recommendations

1. Consider implementing server-side validation that better handles diverse image formats
2. Add more detailed error reporting from the API to help identify specific validation issues
3. Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the property submission flow
