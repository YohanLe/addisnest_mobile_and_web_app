# Property Edit Form Data Population Fix

## Problem

When clicking on the edit button from the account management action grid, the property edit form showed incorrect data for several fields:

1. **Regional State**: Not selecting the correct state from dropdown
2. **City**: Not populating correctly
3. **Property Address**: Showing "[object Object]" instead of the actual address
4. **Images**: Not loading properly
5. **Amenities**: Not selecting the correct amenities

These issues stem from inconsistent data formats between the property listing grid and the edit form, particularly:
- Property address sometimes being stored as an object instead of a string
- Amenities sometimes being stored as an object with boolean values instead of an array
- Regional state selection requiring exact matching against predefined options

## Solution

We implemented several fixes to ensure data is properly normalized and displayed:

### 1. PropertyListingsTab.jsx Fix:
- Enhanced the Edit button click handler to properly handle object-format addresses
- Added proper conversion of object addresses to string format
- Normalized amenities from object format to array format
- Ensured MongoDB ID preservation for proper lookup

### 2. EditPropertyForm.jsx Fix:
- Improved regional state matching with multi-level fallbacks:
  - First attempt exact match
  - Then partial match
  - Then smart defaults (e.g., if "Addis" appears anywhere, default to Addis Ababa)
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Added fallback mechanisms for all property fields

## Testing

The fixes were tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**: The `test-edit-property-fix.js` script simulates clicking the Edit button with different property data formats.

2. **Integration Test**: The `test-edit-property-fix.html` page provides a UI to test the data conversion and verify proper form population.

3. **Batch Test**: The `start-property-edit-test.bat` file provides an easy way to run all tests.

## How to Test

1. Run the application server (port 5173)
2. Execute `start-property-edit-test.bat`
3. In the opened test page:
   - Click "Simulate Edit Click" on a test case
   - Click "Open Edit Form" to see the form populated with the test data
   - Verify that all fields are correctly populated

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Data Handling**: The system now handles multiple data formats seamlessly
2. **Better Field Matching**: Enhanced logic for regional state and other dropdown selections
3. **Proper Address Formatting**: Addresses are now properly converted from object to string format
4. **Amenity Normalization**: Support for both array and object formats of amenities
5. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Added fallbacks and defaults to ensure a good user experience even with incomplete data

These fixes ensure that the property edit form now correctly displays all property data regardless of the format it was originally stored in.
