# Property Image Display Fix in Account Management

## Problem
Property images were not displaying correctly in the account management listings grid after a user submits a property form. The issue was that image paths in the data structure sometimes lacked the required leading slash, causing broken image references.

## Solution
Updated the image path resolution logic in the `PropertyListingsTab.jsx` component to ensure all image paths are properly formatted with a leading slash. The fix now checks if the path starts with '/' and adds it if missing.

## Implementation Details

### Changes made to `src/components/account-management/sub-component/account-tab/PropertyListingsTab.jsx`:

```diff
- if (typeof mainImage === 'string') {
-   console.log("Using string URL from media_paths");
-   return mainImage;
- } else if (mainImage.filePath) {
-   console.log("Using filePath from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.filePath;
- } else if (mainImage.url) {
-   console.log("Using url from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.url;
- } else if (mainImage.path) {
-   console.log("Using path from media_paths object");
-   return mainImage.path;
- }

+ if (typeof mainImage === 'string') {
+   console.log("Using string URL from media_paths");
+   return mainImage.startsWith('/') ? mainImage : `/${mainImage}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.filePath) {
+   console.log("Using filePath from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.filePath;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.url) {
+   console.log("Using url from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.url;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ } else if (mainImage.path) {
+   console.log("Using path from media_paths object");
+   const path = mainImage.path;
+   return path.startsWith('/') ? path : `/${path}`;
+ }
```

Similar changes were made to all the image path resolution code in the component, ensuring consistent path handling throughout.

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Using the Property Image Display Test Page

1. Open the HTML test page:
   ```
   property-image-display-test.html
   ```

2. This page provides:
   - Explanation of the fix
   - Sample property card showing an image from the uploads folder
   - A button to set up test data in localStorage and redirect to the account management page

3. Click the "Test in Account Management" button to:
   - Store test property data in localStorage (including one with a leading slash and one without)
   - Set up mock authentication
   - Redirect to the account management page

4. Verify that both test properties show their images correctly in the grid

### Method 2: Manually Submitting a Property

1. Start the application with the fixed server:
   ```
   node fixed-launcher.js
   ```

2. Navigate to the Property List Form page
3. Create a new property with images
4. Complete the submission process
5. Go to Account Management and verify images are displaying correctly

## Technical Details

The root cause of the issue was inconsistent path formatting in the property data structure. Some image paths in the data were stored with a leading slash (e.g., `/uploads/image.jpg`), while others were stored without it (e.g., `uploads/image.jpg`). 

The browser requires paths to start with a slash when they're relative to the site root. The fix ensures all paths are properly formatted regardless of how they're stored in the data structure.
